# ImprovedForever

## Window focus: look and behave like the game's own windows

Every window of ours that takes the gamepad (Library, Destroy, Add Task, vendor
Tasks, the auction window, its confirmation, the config window) shows and passes
focus the way Forever's native windows do. The shared code is
`ImprovedForever/Focus.lua` (`IF.Focus`). Use it, don't hand-roll a copy.

### Focus ring
- Use the window's own `FrameGlow`: `IF.Focus.Glow(win, focused)`.
  `DefaultPanelFlatTemplate` and `PortraitFrameTemplate` already have one, laid
  out for the template and coloured by the controller options.
- Never build the glow from the atlas yourself
  (`gamepad-uiframemetal-*-focus`), and never tint it from
  `GamepadFocusStateColor`. The game draws its glow untinted until those
  options change, so a copy never matches.
- Show the glow only while the window has the pad. Hide our button legend while
  it doesn't, as native windows do.
- While ours has the pad, dim the game's focus (cursor, focused window's glow
  and footer) with `IF.Focus.DimNative(win, true)`, and restore it with
  `false`. This only changes alpha. Nothing of the game's state is written.

### L2 / R2
- Build the window's switch with `IF.Focus.Switch(win, { onChange, other?, label? })`:
  - `sw:Hint()` gives the legend entry.
  - Call `sw:Press(key)` for LT/RT on our catcher.
  - Call `sw:Update()` from `OnUpdate`.
  - Use `sw:Set("ours" | "game")` to switch.
- The direction follows the screen side. The pad goes to the game window that
  still has the game's focus (the one ours was opened from): L2 if that window
  is on our left, R2 if on our right. The other trigger, pressed on that window
  (or the next one along toward ours), brings the pad back.
- The legend label is the target's `GetJumpHintLabel()`, else the game's
  PREVIOUS / NEXT.
- Never call the frame manager's `Focus*` / `FrameShown` / `ShowUIPanel` from
  addon code. Only read `GamepadMode.FrameControlsManager`
  (`shownFrames`, `focusedFrame`, `isUIFocused`). Calling them taints window
  closing (ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED on SetPreferredGamepadInteractTarget).
- Take the pad with a catcher frame (`EnableGamePadButton`). Call
  `EnableGamePadButton(false)` right after `SetScript`, because setting the
  handler turns input on.

### Focus indicator (the cursor)
- The element the pad is on gets the game's gamepad cursor:
  `SmartNavigation.Pointer`, its large arrow in `GAMEPAD_SMARTNAV_CURSOR_COLOR`,
  sitting left of the element.
- Use `IF.Focus.Cursor(parent)`, which gives `cur:Point(target)` and `cur:Hide()`.
  For a bare texture, use `IF.Focus.CursorTexture(tex)`.
- These copy the live native cursor: its atlas, its on-screen size, its
  animation (IntroAnim), and its offset from the button (`cursorOffsetX/Y`).
- Never hand-build the arrow with your own atlas, scale or bob animation.
- A cursor shows only in the window that has the pad (the one whose
  `FrameGlow` is on). Show it on one element only: the lit one.
- List rows use `IF.UI.FocusStroke`. It adds the cursor by itself while the row
  is lit at full strength. A dimmed row (alpha or tint under 1, meaning "picked
  but not where the pad is") gets no cursor. Pass the dim through
  `SetVertexColor(r, g, b, a)`, `SetAlpha` or `Light(on, dim)`.

### Placement
- Every side window of ours sits where the game would put a panel. Use
  `IF.Focus.Dock(win)` and never hand-anchor it to another window.
- **Vertical:** `TOP_OFFSET`, lifted when there's no room at the bottom.
- **Horizontal:** beside whatever is already open along the top, the game's
  spacing between:
  - the game's panel slots (`GetUIPanel("left"/"center"/"right"/"doublewide")`)
  - its gamepad window row (`shownFrames`, where Character lives)
  - windows of ours placed elsewhere but counted (`IF.Focus.AlongTop(win)`,
    like the auction window)
  - our docked windows opened earlier
- **Nothing open:** the first panel slot (`LEFT_OFFSET` + 35, the Professions
  window's place).
- **Full width:** count each window's full width, including its UI-panel
  extra width (Character's side tabs) and parts hanging off its right side.
- **Not along the top:** the bags and the loot window don't count.
- **No room past them:** as far right as the window fits.
- **Re-placed as windows come and go:** every docked window is checked a few
  times a second while shown.
- Don't hand placement to the game's panel manager: an addon panel there
  taints it.
- This includes the Improved Forever config window. Center only
  confirmations, the way the game centres its dialogs.

## Checks
- `luajit -bl <file>` for syntax.
- `luajit -bl <file> | grep -oE 'GGET.*"[A-Za-z_]+"'` for stray globals.
- `luajit tools/loadcheck.lua each` to load every module alone with the core.
